How do I approach designing software?
From designing this project, I learned that I should develop more reusable functions through encapsulation and separating data from functions. I was able to finish this
project without any major consequences in performance, but I should not think that software for the project I just made would be acceptable as professional work.

How do I approach developing programs?
I develop programs through an iterative process as most of the time I don't get my desired result on the first try. By testing my code for the desired result, I am able
to refine the areas that are lacking and learn from the errors I created. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science can help me in reaching my goals as I want to work towards developing a procedural game world built almost solely on simulation. Not only will I learn 
the programing principles for coding and articial intelligence, but also practices to help me reduce compututational runtime and coding structures to best handle the 
data I'm working with.
